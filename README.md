# Battleship
A Battleship implementation in which a real player plays against an unsophisticated AI that makes entirely random moves. Ship placement is randomized for both the player and the AI.

## Technologies Used
- JaveScript (with Vite for bundling)
- HTML and CSS
- Node.js (package management)
- Jest with Babel for testing

## Features
### Odin Requirements
- Implement features using Test Driven Development
- A Ship class that tracks ship length, the number of times a ship has been hit, and whether or not it has been sunk
- A Gameboard class that handles placing ships, sending attacks and recording them as hits or misses, and tracks whether or not all ships have been sunk
- A Player class with its own gameboard
- Display both the player and enemy gameboards
- Allow the player to attack by clicking the enemy gameboard
- Random ship placement
- Project deployment

## Future Work
- Improve AI intelligence
- Make page design responsive
- Allow players to place their own ships
- Implement 2 player mode
- Allow custom ship lengths
- Add coordinate labels to gameboard

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained experience with Test Driven Development and unit testing in general
